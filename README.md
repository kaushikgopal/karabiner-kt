# Playground KT

This is a playground for me to quickly test and run simple kotlin programs out. I initially 
used this template for my [Advent of Coding](https://adventofcode.com/).

Idea is clone this repo, start coding.

To execute the program in the `main()` function of `App.kt`, simply run the following command:

```shell
./gradlew run
```
