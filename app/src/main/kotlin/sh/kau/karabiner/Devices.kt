// Using the Identifiers data class from Types.kt
// If DEVICE entries are directly serialized as part of DEVICE_CONFIGS,
// then Identifiers and its fields should be @Serializable and use @SerialName if needed.
// For now, assuming they are primarily for constructing DeviceIfCondition etc.

// We'll define DEVICE_COMBO and DEVICE_CONFIGS next.
// For DEVICE_CONFIGS, we'll need a new data class.
